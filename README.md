# GiantsEdit source code

## About

This is a fork of the original [GiantsEdit](https://github.com/Kabuto/GiantsEdit) repository by Kabuto.

The original application has been rewritten to use .NET 10, Avalonia and OpenGL instead of Delphi/Pascal code. The conversion was largely vibe-coded by Opus 4.6 with some manual tweaks here and there.

The new application is more compatible with the latest unofficial patches of Giants: Citizen Kabuto and has numerous new features.

## License

The code retains the GPL v2 license from the original project. All credit for GiantsEdit's creation goes to Kabuto.
